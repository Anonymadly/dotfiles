# dotfiles

Please note that I use the Colemak keyboard layout. Any mapping configurations are not designed for QWERTY.

Run `install.sh` to symlink all dotfiles to your home. It will back up any folders/files already present.
Run `uninstall.sh` to delete symlinks or replace symlinks with the source folder (if you want to delete the repository but keep the files).

`Other Config Files` stores files that will be skipped by both scripts. Read its README for more information.
